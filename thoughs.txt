# What needs to be done?

Frontend:

- Entire front end needs to be created
- What does the web app look like
    Probably best to make the web app first before I even start to think about the mobile app

Backend:

- Entire backend needs to be created
- What does the backend even do?
    - Two thoughts when it comes to the basic functionality
    - User functionality
        - Create a user
        - User log in
            - What does a user look like?
                A user will have 

    - Climb functionality
        - Create a Climb
            - What does a climb look like?
                A climb object will have fields such as
                    climbID/climbName/climbGrade/gymID/setBy/photoOfClimb/videoOfBeta
                So there needs to be a backend function for creating a climb.
                createClimb() will take a climb name, gymID, climbPhoto and a setBy value and create an instance and ID.
                The other parts such as grade and videoOfBeta can be uploaded later




Blueprint of Objects that this app will have:


Gyms / Users / Competitions / Climbs

Users are linked to one or many Gyms
Competitions are linked to one gym
Climbs are linked to gyms, and can be part of a Competitions


Gyms:
gymID/gymName/climbsList (list of climbs) /competitionsList

Climb:
climbID/climbName/climbGrade (maybe) /climbSetBy(userID)/climbPhoto/climbBetaVideo (maybe) /competitionID (maybe)

Competitions
competitionID/compName/compRules (json)/ climbers (list of userID)/ climbs (list of climbs) / leaderboard (maybe, not sure how to work this yet)

Users:
userID/name/registeredGyms (list of gyms) /registeredCompetitions (list of comps) / setClimbs (list of climbID) / completedClimbs (list of climbID) / role (climber/setter/admin)


    
Plan for the time being,

Have the ability to create a user and create a climb. Then that user can interact with that climb
