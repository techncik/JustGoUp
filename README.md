# JustGoUp
Just Go Up (JGU) is an all-in-one climbing gym companion app that I am currently developing. Climbers will be able to keep track of all of their climbing with one app. Gyms will have access to a dashboard to organise everything from climbs and competitions, to staff and members.

## Key Features
- Climbing gyms will be able to register their gym on JGU. In doing so, they can create a floorplan of their climbing space to create a map
- Gym staff can easily upload climbs they set and place them on the gym map, along with photos and beta videos
- Gym owners will have the ability to host competitions entirely through the app
- Climbers using JGU will be able to see all the climbs within the gym, keep a logbook of their ticks and projects, and follow their progress with statistics
- Anyone will be able to create climbs within a gym using any holds already on the wall, and anyone within the gym will be able to climb these custom routes
